## Remittance Chatbot

Remittance is a major source of revenue for many developing countries. The goal of this project is to develop a chatbot that provides simple answers to user questions on remittance figures, platforms, and services using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). 

The chatbot leverages the power of natural language processing (NLP) to provide accurate and relevant information by combining a pre-trained language model (GPT3.5) with a document retrieval system.
